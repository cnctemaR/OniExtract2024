After the Export: What the Website Does With Your Files
Direction: website → export. Read this before changing the exported assets (especially
image resolution) so a change on your side doesn't quietly break rendering on ours.

You export from the game and get a folder of files. You drop that folder into the website repo
(./export) and run one script. This explains what that script does, what each image is used
for, and — the part you actually care about right now — what happens if you make the images
bigger / higher resolution.

The one step you run
npm run import:2024
(Yes, the name is unfortunate — "2024" leaked everywhere from the OniExtract2024 milestone.
There's a convert:2024 alias and an import:2024:dry-run that validates without writing.
Renaming is on our cleanup list; behaviour is what matters here.)

You hand over a folder containing:

you ship	we use it for
database/*.json (13 files)	building/element data (we actually read only 3 — see end)
ui_image/<prefabId>.png	the single icon per building
connection_sprites/<prefabId>/<0..15>.png	the 16 tiling states for connectables
ui_image_facade/	nothing (we don't use it today)

What the images are used for
There are two kinds of images, used very differently:

1. ui_image/ — one flat icon per building.
Shown in the build/select menu and as the picture of a placed, non-tiling building. Each is
stretched to fill the building's footprint box (1 tile = 100 px on screen), bottom-anchored.
Because we stretch-to-footprint with no placement data, the icon's content must be the
footprint — see the framing section below; this is what the animation-based export broke.

2. connection_sprites/<prefabId>/0..15.png — the 16 states of a connectable.
For wires, pipes, rails, and tiles. When you place a run of them, the editor picks the right
one of the 16 by looking at which neighbours connect (a 4-bit code: left=1, right=2, up=4,
down=8; e.g. 15.png = connected on all four sides). These must tile flush against their
neighbours, so how they're framed matters (see resolution rules below).

The steam turbine you saw looking blurry is a ui_image/ icon (it's not a connectable) —
so fixing it is purely "ship a sharper ui_image/SteamTurbine.png." No script change.

⭐ Increasing image resolution — yes please, here's the rule
Good news: our pipeline is resolution-independent. You can ship bigger, sharper images and
in almost all cases we need to change nothing. Here's why, per image type:

ui_image/ icons (e.g. the steam turbine):

Resolution itself is free: we scale each icon to the building footprint, so a bigger source
PNG is just a sharper downscale. Caveat: one test asserts each flat-icon PNG is under
5 MB — ping us if one will exceed that.
⚠️ BUT there is a framing assumption — see the next section. We stretch the icon to fill
the footprint box exactly, so the icon's content must be the footprint. Switching from
footprint-framed UI sprites to tight-cropped animation renders breaks this (squished
aspect, lost overhang) even though the pixels got sharper. That part is NOT free.
connection_sprites/:

We don't assume any fixed pixel size. For each connectable we measure a scale factor
(canvas px ÷ cell px) from the all-connected 15.png every time you import, and render at
that ratio. Double the resolution and the ratio is unchanged → same on-screen size, sharper
texture. Also no script change.
The measurement re-runs on every import:2024, so it adapts automatically to new pixel sizes.
The one thing that breaks us is changing the framing, not the resolution. Keep these and
you can re-export at any resolution freely:

All 16 states of a building keep one shared canvas size and one cell registration
(same centre, same pixels-per-cell across the 16). Scale them up together.
In the all-connected state (15.png), the opaque pixels still equal exactly one cell,
centred in the canvas. (Overhang/caps on disconnected sides in the other states is fine —
that bleeds past the cell on purpose.) This state is our measuring stick; if it gains
overhang or goes off-centre, our scale goes wrong.
When would a resolution change also need a script fix here? Only if it comes with a
framing change — e.g. you switch connection sprites to a different cell-to-canvas ratio AND
that breaks rule 2 above, or you change how ui_image icons are framed (next section).
Pure "same framing, more pixels" = zero changes on our side.

⚠️ ui_image framing — the steam-turbine / auto-sweeper problem
Symptom (animation-based export): the steam turbine's overhang no longer hangs below the
footprint, the auto-sweeper looks squished. Higher resolution, but the geometry is wrong.

Cause. Today the website stretches each ui_image to exactly fill the footprint box
(widthInCells × heightInCells, one cell = 100 px, bottom-anchored), with no per-image
placement data. That only looks right when the image's opaque content equals the footprint.

The old UI-sprite export produced footprint-shaped icons, so the stretch was harmless.
The animation/tight-crop export crops to the art's true bounding box, which is taller
and/or wider than the footprint because the art overhangs it. Stretching that into the
footprint box crushes the overhang and squishes the proportions. (Measured: new icons are
tight-cropped, ~0 px padding; SteamTurbine2's art is ~5×4.24 cells — over a cell taller than
its 5×3 footprint — so forcing it into 5×3 squashes the exhaust up instead of letting it hang.)
The website cannot fix this from the image alone — a single cropped icon has no cell
reference, so we can't infer the scale or where the footprint sits within the overhang. (This
differs from connection sprites, where the all-connected state gives us a 1-cell reference.) We
measured: ~150 of 449 icons deviate from their footprint by >15% (68 by >30%) — it is systemic,
not a handful. The render scale clusters near ~208 px/cell but with a ±28% spread, so even the
size can't be inferred reliably.

The contract: uiImageRect (DECIDED — the website already consumes it)
Emit, per building, the rendered PNG's rectangle in cell units, relative to the footprint:

// on each building.json bBuildingDefList[] entry; OMIT it to mean "image == footprint"
"uiImageRect": { "x": 0, "y": -1, "w": 5, "h": 4 }
Coordinate space: the footprint occupies (0,0) (bottom-left) to (widthInCells, heightInCells)
(top-right). +x right, +y up. Units = cells.
x, y = bottom-left corner of the image in that space; w, h = image size in cells.
Overhang is expressed by going outside the footprint: y negative ⇒ art hangs below
(steam turbine exhaust); x+w > widthInCells ⇒ art extends right; etc.
The rect describes the whole PNG (not just its opaque pixels). The PNG maps linearly onto
the rectangle, so its pixel aspect must equal w:h — true automatically if you tight-crop.
Values are real numbers, not whole cells — do not round to integers.
Example (verified in-editor): SteamTurbine2, footprint 5×3, PNG 1033×876 at ~206 px/cell
→ { x: 0, y: -1.24, w: 5, h: 4.24 } (≈1.24 cells of exhaust hanging below). A footprint-
filling icon → { x:0, y:0, w:W, h:H } (identical to omitting it).
This is the same information the 2020/2023 atlas carried as pivot + realSize.

How to compute it (export side)
You render each building's kanim to a tight-cropped PNG, so in one world frame you know the
art's world bounding box and the footprint's position (which cells it occupies). Let
ppc = your render scale in pixels per cell, and take the footprint's bottom-left corner
as the origin. Then:

w = imgPxW / ppc                      // image width in cells
h = imgPxH / ppc                      // image height in cells
x = (artLeft   - footprintLeft)   / cellSize   // cells the PNG's left edge sits right of the footprint's left
y = (artBottom - footprintBottom) / cellSize   // cells the PNG's bottom sits ABOVE the footprint's bottom
Watch the Y sign. Our +y is up. Game/image space is usually +y down — if you compute
in image space, flip the sign so a building whose art hangs below the footprint gets a
negative y (as SteamTurbine2 does). This is the single most likely place to get it wrong.
x is usually 0 and w usually equals the footprint width (most overhang is vertical), but
emit the real measured values either way — side overhang (x < 0 and/or x+w > W) happens too.
Emit it for every building (even footprint-filling ones get their exact rect); omitting is
only the legacy fallback.
Website side is done and shipped: the converter passes uiImageRect through to the DB, and
the renderer draws the icon into that rectangle (unit-tested). Buildings without it keep the
old stretch-to-footprint, so nothing regresses while you roll the field out. Watch the converter
log line buildings with uiImageRect placement: N / 449 to track coverage.

What the script does (for reference)
Reads building.json, elements.json, uiSpriteInfo.json; maps them to the website's
internal shape (field renames, viewMode hash → overlay, flat-icon model, build menu).
Detects connectables (a connection_sprites/<prefabId>/ dir exists) and measures each
one's scale factor from 15.png.
Writes database-2024.json + two database-2024.zip files.
Mirrors ui_image/ and connection_sprites/ into both served asset roots (assets/ and
frontend/src/assets/), replacing the targets so renamed/removed files don't linger.
ui_image_facade/ is not copied.
Validates and exits non-zero if anything is incomplete (missing icon, a connection dir
missing one of 0–15, a connectable that's neither tile nor utility, etc.).
It's repeatable; re-running on the same export is safe (only the .zip bytes differ run-to-run).

Contract — don't break these (everything else can change freely)
Icon naming: ui_image/<prefabId>.png, filename == building.json name. (An older
doc said icons are named by display name — reality is prefabId; that's what we rely on.)
Connection sprites: all 16 of 0–15 present, bitmask left=1/right=2/up=4/down=8.
Connectable signal: the connection_sprites/<prefabId>/ directory exists.
Connection-sprite geometry: the two framing rules in the resolution section above
(shared canvas/registration across the 16; state 15 = one cell, centred).
4b. ui_image framing: tight-cropped animation icons require a per-building uiImageRect
(cells, footprint-relative — see the framing section). Omit it only for icons whose art is
the footprint. The website already consumes it; you just need to emit it.
Building fields we read keep their names/shapes: name, nameString, isFoundation,
isKAnimTile, isUtility, widthInCells, heightInCells, sceneLayer, objectLayer,
viewMode, permittedRotations, dragBuild, buildLocationRule, materialCategory,
materialMass; plus top-level bBuildingDefList, buildMenuCategories,
buildingAndSubcategoryDataPairs, buildVersion. Adding fields is safe.
We also inject a few overlay sprites of our own (element_tile_back, *_tile_front,
info_back, info_front_0..11) — don't try to provide these.

Open questions back to the export
ui_image_facade/ (988 files): unused by us. Drop it to shrink the handoff, or tell us
what it's for and we'll wire it.
10 of 13 JSONs unused (db, recipe, tags, attribute, po_string, entities, multiEntities, food, geyser, items): intentional/future, or trim? (po_string is the likely next one we'd
want, for i18n.)
Higher-res ui_image: if any icon will exceed ~5 MB, tell us so we raise the test bound
ahead of time.
ui_image framing (ACTIVE — your next export task): decided to go with full per-building
placement. Emit uiImageRect (cells, footprint-relative) for every building (≈150 deviate,
the rest can omit it / set it to the footprint). Website consumption is already shipped and
unit-tested; the converter logs buildings with uiImageRect placement: N / 449 so you can
track rollout. This revives the pivot/realSize your renderer already computes.
